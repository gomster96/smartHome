# Blink
- It is really basic exaple for using RaspberryPi

- compile command : gcc blink.c -lwiringPi

1. Set Pin number. 
	- To use GPIO pin, we have to check what pin number will we use.
2. wiringPiSetup();
	- It is kind of declaration about using wiringPi
3. write code 

** we have to pay attention ** 
- The PinNuber and WiringPi GPIO are different.
- So I attach that table to check that
